# Advanced Development Roadmap

The evolution of Quantum Composer from a simple visual composer into an
educational **quantum simulation lab + quantum cryptography lab**, and where it
can honestly go next.

## V1 baseline retained

- The original V1 exact request path remains limited to 1–8 qubits. The current
  interactive grid can describe up to 128 qubits, uses a two-stage rendered-cell
  guard (warn, then pause), and sends simulation outside the full V1 envelope to
  V2. Wider structured circuits exist as generated descriptors in Simulator Lab.
- Strict Pydantic-validated circuit JSON — **no user Python is ever executed**.
- Qiskit code generation and OpenQASM 2 export.
- Local Qiskit Aer simulation with counts histogram, depth, gate counts, and a
  headless Qiskit Matplotlib SVG circuit diagram. Legacy text fields remain
  API-only for older callers.
- Presets: superposition, Bell, GHZ, teleportation skeleton, Deutsch–Jozsa,
  Grover, BB84 encode/decode.

## V2 completed features

### Multi-engine simulation

- `GET /engines` — engine catalog with runtime availability and honest limits.
- `POST /circuit/analyze` — structure + resource analysis (Clifford test,
  T-count, rotation count, statevector/density memory, feasibility, recommended
  engines).
- `POST /circuit/simulate-v2` — engine-routed simulation with `SimulationOptions`.
- Engines: `aer_statevector`, `aer_mps`, `aer_stabilizer`, `aer_density_matrix`,
  optional `stim_stabilizer`, and an honest `auto` router.
- Log-space resource estimator that never overflows, with safe/heavy/dangerous/
  infeasible risk labels and absolute hard qubit caps for exact engines.
- Rejects circuits classified as infeasible with a clear explanation before
  engine execution. Deployment-level memory, CPU, concurrency, and timeout
  controls remain necessary.

### Quantum cryptography lab

- `POST /crypto/bb84/simulate`, `/crypto/e91/simulate`, `/crypto/b92/simulate`,
  `/crypto/qrng/simulate` — protocol-level statistical simulators; an explicit
  repeated seed makes a run deterministic.
- QBER, Eve intercept-resend, CHSH indicator (E91), conclusive-measurement stats
  (B92), and Toeplitz-hash privacy amplification.

### Frontend

- Shared scientific app shell with backend health, mode/status rail, responsive
  navigation, and visible structured-large-circuit limits.
- **Composer** workspace with indexed circuit grid, gate details, direct
  feasibility analysis, complete V1/V2 routing, and full-width code/results.
- **Simulator Lab** tab: engine selector with availability, resource estimates,
  method guide, Clifford classification, feasibility badges, large-circuit
  teaching presets, result metadata, and clear rejection messages.
- **Cryptography Lab** tab: BB84 / E91 / B92 / QRNG protocol flows,
  key/correlation views, QBER/CHSH, QRNG bias diagnostics, and educational
  boundaries.

### Post-simulation quantum-state analysis and viewers

- `POST /circuit/simulate-v2` can optionally return the actual backend-computed
  state for the run (`include_state_analysis` and related options) — a typed,
  versioned `state_analysis` object, not a re-labeled copy of Composer's local
  preview. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and
  [SIMULATION_ENGINES.md](SIMULATION_ENGINES.md) for the full pipeline and
  per-engine support matrix.
- **Statevector viewer**: amplitudes, probabilities, and phases (Dirac
  notation, a probability table with per-qubit marginals, a phase wheel with
  an always-paired numeric table) for `aer_statevector`/`aer_mps` results, up
  to a documented qubit ceiling.
- **Bloch sphere** for exact-simulable circuits, now driven by the real
  backend result: one sphere per qubit's own reduced state (a qubit selector,
  not one global sphere for a multi-qubit state), with an explicit
  explanation of why a reduced state is mixed when it is. The Bell-state
  regression (each qubit's reduced Bloch vector at the origin while the
  global two-qubit state stays pure and maximally entangled) is covered by
  both a backend unit test and a Playwright screenshot baseline.
- **Density matrix viewer** for small noisy circuits: trace, purity, entropy,
  Hermiticity error, a bounded magnitude heatmap with an accessible table
  fallback, and diagonal basis-state probabilities.
- **Entanglement view**: two-qubit concurrence, Schmidt coefficients and
  entanglement entropy per bipartition, and per-qubit reduced purity — with
  an explicit disclaimer that this is not a complete entanglement
  classification for arbitrary mixed, multipartite states.
- Export (JSON with full metadata, CSV of the amplitude/probability table)
  and an explicit local-preview-vs-backend-result comparison action in
  Composer, both manual, never run automatically on edit.

### Hardware Mapping and responsive hardening

- `/hardware` maps a resolved Composer/imported circuit against generic,
  version-discovered fake, validated manual, or authenticated account-scoped
  IBM targets. OpenQASM 2 works in the base install; OpenQASM 3 and IBM Runtime
  integrations are optional. Pasted Python is rejected and never executed.
- The backend normalizes target/coupling/calibration metadata and uses Qiskit's
  target-aware preset pass manager with explicit optimization, seed, layout,
  and routing controls. The response contains initial/final layouts, active/
  idle qubits, direct metrics, captured routing SWAPs, used edges, duration,
  and a disclosed heuristic—not an invented fidelity.
- The SVG topology supports calibration/activity/routing overlays, pan/zoom/
  fit/search/export, accessible non-color cues, and synchronized qubit/edge/
  SWAP selection. Up to six targets can be compared with a documented score;
  queue never decides by itself.
- Environment or saved Qiskit accounts are preferred. Optional session
  credentials are backend-memory-only, clearable, HTTPS/origin/rate/timeout
  protected, redacted, and absent from logs/responses/browser persistence.
- The four workspaces and key dialogs/results have document-overflow regression
  coverage for the required desktop, tablet, phone, landscape, and 80–200%
  layout-zoom matrix. The Composer→Simulator and Composer→Hardware resolved
  custom-gate handoffs are covered end to end.

## Future (not yet built)

### Execution & realism

- **IBM backend execution** via a reviewed server-side Qiskit Runtime adapter
  (credentials stay server-side; explicit authorization, job polling, quotas).
- **Real backend noise models** imported from device calibration data.
- A NumPy-compatible `.npy`/`.npz` state export (JSON/CSV exist today).
- Direct reduced-state extraction from MPS tensors, avoiding the full
  statevector conversion Aer's public API currently requires.

### Cryptography

- **Cascade-style reconciliation** demo (interactive error correction).
- Deeper **privacy amplification** with adjustable security parameters.
- **Toy Grover key-search** demo (√N speedup vs classical brute force).
- **Toy Shor/RSA threat** mode (educational factoring intuition).
- **PQC comparison** panel: ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA vs classical + QKD.

## Guiding principle

Every expansion must **accept declarative data, validate it, and dispatch
explicitly — never execute client-provided Python** — and must stay
**technically honest** about what classical simulation can and cannot do. Larger
qubit counts are supported only where circuit structure allows (Clifford/MPS);
arbitrary large universal circuits are rejected with an explanation, and real
quantum hardware is never conflated with classical statevector simulation.
